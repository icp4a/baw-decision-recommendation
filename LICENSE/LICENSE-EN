Third Party Data and Services

The Program provides access to third party data services, databases, web services, software, or other third party content (all, "Third Party Content"). Access to this Third Party Content is provided "AS-IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Access can be terminated by the relevant third parties at their sole discretion at any time. Licensee may be required to enter into separate agreements with the third parties for the access to or use of such Third Party Content. IBM is not a party to any such separate agreements and as an express condition of this license Licensee agrees to comply with the terms of such separate agreements.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Authorized User

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.

Concurrent User

Concurrent User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Concurrent User is a person who is accessing the Program at any particular point in time. Regardless of whether the person is simultaneously accessing the Program multiple times, the person counts only as a single Concurrent User. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers, but Licensee must obtain entitlements for the maximum number of Concurrent Users simultaneously accessing the Program. Licensee must obtain an entitlement for each simultaneous Concurrent User accessing the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means.

Processor Value Unit (PVU)

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the Processor Value Unit (PVU) licensing for Distributed Software website at https://supportcontent.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-processor-value-unit-pvu-licensing-distributed-software) and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Licensee is permitted to process 150 Content Operations and 300 Workflow Operations in a single calendar day for each Concurrent User entitlement obtained to the Program.

A Content Operation is each access or update to a document, folder or custom object within the Program as measured in the Program's usage tracking.

A Workflow Operation is accessing or performing a task in a workflow instance within the Program as measured in the Program's usage tracking. Each single workflow instance update counts as one individual Workflow Operation.

Entitlement Conversion Details

Entitlement Values

IBM Business Automation Workflow Enterprise

- Conversion Entitlement Ratio: 14 PVUs / 1 VPC

- Conversion Entitlement Ratio: 28 Non-Production PVUs / 1 VPC

- Conversion Entitlement Ratio: 5 Concurrent Users / 1 VPC or any one or any combination of any of the user measurements below:

- Conversion Entitlement Ratio: 9 Authorized Users / 1 VPC

- Conversion Entitlement Ratio: 18 Employee Users / 1 VPC

- Conversion Entitlement Ratio: 90 Infrequent Users / 1 VPC

- Conversion Entitlement Ratio: 1782 External Users / 1 VPC

"Conversion Entitlement Ratio n/m" means that Licensee can convert some number ('n') entitlements of the indicated metric for the listed program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the specified metric for the Program. Once converted, Licensee may only use such converted entitlements for the listed program. The specified conversion does not apply to any entitlements for the Program that are not of the required metric type.

Infrequent User

Infrequent User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. Any Infrequent Users given access to the Program requires an entitlement. An Infrequent User is an Authorized User who accesses the Program not more than one hundred twenty (120) times in any consecutive 12 month period. A single access is comprised of one or more interactions between the Infrequent User and the Program or actions performed on behalf of the Infrequent User by the Program, all within a consecutive 15 minute period.

Licensee must track accesses by Infrequent Users to verify that they meet the access limitations of Infrequent Users. Licensee agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors details of the tracking mechanism described above, upon request.

Employee User

Employee User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Employee User is a unique person employed in Licensee's Enterprise, whether or not given access to the Program, or a unique person otherwise paid by or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise who is given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Employee User is unique to that Employee User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the entitlement to another person. Licensee must acquire sufficient employee user entitlements to cover all employees and any other unique persons paid by or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise.

External User

External User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An External User is a unique person, not employed in, paid by, or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise, who is given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. A person who is employed in or paid by Licensee's Enterprise, but is not accessing the Program within the scope of that relationship may be an External User. An entitlement for an External User is unique to that External User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the entitlement to another person.

"Use by Developer" means the component can only be deployed as part of Licensee's internal development and unit testing on a developer machine. A developer machine is a physical or virtual desktop environment, running a primary operating system and the Program, both of which are accessible and used by no more than one specified developer. Licensee is not authorized to use the Supporting Program for processing production workloads, simulating production workloads or testing scalability of any code, application or system. Licensee is not authorized to use any part of the Supporting Program for any other purposes without acquiring the appropriate entitlements.
